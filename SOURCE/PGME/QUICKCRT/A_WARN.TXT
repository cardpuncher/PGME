This is a HEADS-UP warning!

This version of QuickCRT is based on an older version. This version was also
"built-out" with a complete Object-Oriented User Interface Framework.

This is not the newest, fastest or best version of QuickCRT (aka QCrt).
However, it is presently the only version that has a complete OO-UI Framework.

For the latest version of QuickCRT, please see https://github.com/LoopZ/QCrt
